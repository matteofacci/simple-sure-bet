# Simple Sure Bet
A simple criterion to determine if a bet on two possible events can be definitely winning.

We talk about sure bet when a specific condition is met, that is: 1/odd(1) + 1/odd(2) + 1/odd(n) <1. 

Let's take the case of a tennis match, given that there are only two possible events, namely 1 and 2 . If we are faced with these two odds: Federer (2.10) and Djokovic (2.10), then we are faced with a sure bet, since 1/2.10 + 1/2.10 is equal to 0.952 and therefore we could draw a mathematical gain by betting on both outcomes.
